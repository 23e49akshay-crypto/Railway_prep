🧪 General Science
Topic: Chemistry (10th Level – Railway Focus)
1️⃣ Clear Theory (Easy Language)

Railway Chemistry mostly includes:

Matter & its states

Acids, Bases & Salts

Metals & Non-metals

Periodic Table basics

Chemical reactions

pH scale

👉 Questions are:

Direct concept-based

Reaction-based

Formula-based

2️⃣ Important Concepts & Formulas
🔹 States of Matter

Solid → Fixed shape & volume

Liquid → Fixed volume

Gas → No fixed shape

🔹 pH Scale

0–6 → Acid

7 → Neutral

8–14 → Base

🔹 Important Reactions

Zn + HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂

Na + H₂O → NaOH + H₂

Rusting: Fe + O₂ + H₂O

🔹 Atomic Number = Number of protons
🔹 Mass Number = Protons + Neutrons
🧠 Quick Tricks (Railway Favourite)

Strong acid → HCl, H₂SO₄

Base → NaOH, KOH

Remember common gas tests (H₂ pop sound)
