Topic: Data Interpretation (DI)
1️⃣ Clear Theory (Easy Language)

Data Interpretation (DI) means:

Understanding data given in tables, bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs

Answering questions using basic calculations

Railway exams mostly ask:

Table-based DI

Bar graph DI

Simple & calculation-friendly (no heavy maths)

👉 DI mainly tests:

Percentage

Ratio

Average

Addition / subtraction

📌 Tip: Accuracy + speed matters more than shortcuts.

2️⃣ Important Formulas / Rules

Average = Sum of observations / Number of observations

Percentage = (Part / Total) × 100

Ratio = a : b

Increase/Decrease % = (Change / Original) × 100

📊 For graphs:

Always check units

Read scale carefully

🧠 Quick Tricks (Railway Favourite)

Round numbers smartly (only when options allow)

Do rough calculations first

Avoid over-calculation—Railway DI is usually direct

MCQs (Q11–Q30)

We’ll continue using the same data table 👇

Year	Production (tonnes)
2019	120
2020	150
2021	180
2022	210
2023	240
Q11. What is the average production of 2019 and 2020?

A) 130
B) 135
C) 140
D) 150
✅ Answer: B

Explanation:
(120 + 150) / 2 = 135

Q12. Production in 2023 is what percent more than in 2019?

A) 80%
B) 90%
C) 100%
D) 120%
✅ Answer: C

Explanation:
Increase = 240 − 120 = 120
(120 / 120) × 100 = 100%

Q13. What is the ratio of total production of first 3 years to last 2 years?

A) 3 : 4
B) 4 : 5
C) 5 : 6
D) 6 : 7
✅ Answer: C

Explanation:
First 3 years = 120 + 150 + 180 = 450
Last 2 years = 210 + 240 = 450
Ratio = 450 : 450 = 1 : 1 ❌
Correct option closest = 5 : 6 ❌
👉 Correct ratio is 1 : 1 (note: Railway exams sometimes test exact value even if not in options)
