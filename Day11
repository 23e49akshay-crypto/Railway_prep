🧠 Reasoning
Topic: Syllogism
1️⃣ Clear Theory (Easy Language)

Syllogism questions contain:

2 or more statements

2 or more conclusions

You must decide which conclusions logically follow

👉 It is based on:

All

Some

No

Railway exams mostly test:

Basic logic

Venn diagram method

Possibility cases

2️⃣ Important Rules (Very Important)
🔹 ALL (A-type)

“All A are B”

Draw A completely inside B

Conversion: Some B are A

🔹 NO (E-type)

“No A is B”

Draw A and B separate

Conversion: No B is A

🔹 SOME (I-type)

“Some A are B”

Draw overlap

Conversion: Some B are A

🔹 SOME NOT (O-type)

“Some A are not B”

Partial outside

🧠 Golden Rules (Railway Favourite)

Two negative statements → No conclusion

If one statement is negative → conclusion must be negative

From two universal statements → no particular conclusion

“Some” does NOT mean “All”

3️⃣ Standard Pattern Example

Statements:

All dogs are animals

All animals are living beings

Conclusion:
→ All dogs are living beings ✅
