Topic: Time & Work
1️⃣ Clear Theory (Easy Language)

Work = total job to be done

Time = days/hours taken to finish work

Efficiency = work done per unit time

👉 Key idea:
If someone works faster, they take less time.
If someone works slower, they take more time.

📌 Example:
If A can do a work in 10 days
→ A’s 1 day work = 1/10

Railway exams mostly ask:

One person work

Two persons working together

Efficiency comparison

Men–Days type problems

2️⃣ Important Formulas / Rules

If A can do work in x days
→ 1 day work = 1/x

If A & B together finish in y days
→ (A + B)’s 1 day work = 1/y

Work = Efficiency × Time

If A is x times as efficient as B
→ Time taken by A : B = 1 : x

🧠 Quick Tricks (Very Important for Railways)

Always convert days into fractions (1/x form)

Take LCM of days as total work (fast method)

More efficiency → less time (inverse relation)

A) 8 days
B) 9 days
C) 10 days
D) 12 days
✅ Answer: C

Explanation:
A = 1/15, B = 1/30
Together = 2/30 + 1/30 = 3/30 = 1/10
Time = 10 days

Q12. A alone can do a work in 20 days. B alone can do it in 30 days. In how many days will they finish together?

A) 10
B) 12
C) 15
D) 18
✅ Answer: B

Explanation:
LCM = 60
A = 3 units/day, B = 2 units/day
Total = 5 units/day
Time = 60/5 = 12 days

Q13. A is twice as efficient as B. If B can do a work in 16 days, A can do it in:

A) 4
B) 6
C) 8
D) 10
✅ Answer: C

Explanation:
Efficiency doubles → time halves
A = 8 days

Q14. A can complete a work in 12 days. B can complete the same work in 18 days. How long will they take working together?

A) 6
B) 7.2
C) 8
D) 9
✅ Answer: B

Explanation:
A = 1/12, B = 1/18
LCM = 36
A = 3, B = 2
Total = 5
Time = 36/5 = 7.2 days

Q15. A and B together can do a work in 8 days. A alone can do it in 12 days. B alone can do it in:

A) 12
B) 18
C) 24
D) 30
✅ Answer: C

Explanation:
A+B = 1/8
A = 1/12
B = 1/8 − 1/12 = (3−2)/24 = 1/24
So B = 24 days
