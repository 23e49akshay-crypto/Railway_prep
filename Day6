Topic: Geometry
1️⃣ Clear Theory (Easy Language)

Geometry deals with shapes, lines, angles, and figures.
In Railway exams, questions are mostly:

Formula-based

Direct

Very scoring if formulas are clear

Main focus areas:

Lines & Angles

Triangles

Quadrilaterals

Circles

📌 Example:
A triangle has 3 sides and sum of its angles = 180°

2️⃣ Important Formulas / Rules
🔹 Lines & Angles

Linear pair = 180°

Vertically opposite angles = equal

Sum of angles on a straight line = 180°

🔺 Triangles

Sum of interior angles = 180°

Area of triangle = ½ × base × height

Pythagoras theorem:

In right triangle → a² + b² = c²

◼ Quadrilaterals

Sum of interior angles = 360°

Rectangle:

Area = l × b

Perimeter = 2(l + b)

Square:

Area = a²

Perimeter = 4a

⚪ Circles

Circumference = 2πr

Area = πr²

Diameter = 2r

🧠 Quick Tricks (Railway Favourite)

Memorize angle sums (180°, 360°)

In triangle problems → draw rough figure

Use π = 22/7 unless stated otherwise
