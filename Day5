Topic: Speed & Distance
1️⃣ Clear Theory (Easy Language)

Speed = how fast something moves

Distance = how much ground is covered

Time = duration of movement

👉 These three are connected by one golden formula.

📌 Example:
If a train moves at 60 km/h for 2 hours,
Distance = 60 × 2 = 120 km

Railway exams frequently ask:

Basic speed–distance questions

Trains

Relative speed

Average speed

Boats & streams (sometimes)

2️⃣ Important Formulas / Rules

Speed = Distance / Time

Distance = Speed × Time

Time = Distance / Speed

🚆 Trains

Time to cross pole = Train length / Speed

Time to cross platform = (Train + Platform length) / Speed

🔁 Relative Speed

Same direction → |v₁ − v₂|

Opposite direction → v₁ + v₂

🧠 Average Speed

Equal distances → (2ab)/(a+b)

Equal time → (a+b)/2

🧠 Quick Tricks (Railway Favourite)

Always convert minutes to hours

km/h → m/s ⇒ × 5/18

m/s → km/h ⇒ × 18/5

Faster speed → less time (inverse relation)
